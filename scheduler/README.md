# IO-SDK-SCHEDULER
A simple Node.js REST api for scheduling execution of command line based actions, implemented to be easily added to the IO-SDK platform.

 ## How to use it
 
 Start the server with `npm start` it will show a similar message if everything it is OK.

```
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*
[nodemon] watching extensions: ts
[nodemon] starting `ts-node ./src/index.ts`
IO-SDK REST Api Scheduler is running on 3100
````

The API will be available in this case at the url `http:\\localhost:3100\scheduler`

### Add a new Job

Send a POST to endpoint `http://localhost:3100/scheduler` using this JSON structure as payload

```
{
    "jobName":"testJob",
    "time": "*/1 * * * *",
    "action": "echo test message logged every 1 minute"
}
```

- jobName: this is used to identify the job, using the value a key into the internal storage. It is not allowed to schedule 2 job with the same name. An HTTP 400 error it
is returned if that's the case
- time: it should be a valid cron expression. An HTTP 400 error it is returned if it is not a valid one.
- action: the shell command


Using `curl` this could be achieved with

```
curl -X POST -d '{"jobName":"testJob","time": "*/1 * * * *","action": "echo test message logged every 1 minute"}' http://localhost:3100/scheduler --header "Content-Type:application/json"
```

### Get the list of scheduled job

Send a GET to endpoint `http://localhost:3100/scheduler`

```
curl http://localhost:3100/scheduler

return an array with the scheduled job reference

[
    {
        "error": false,
        "job": {
            "jobName": "testJob",
            "time": "*/1 * * * *",
            "action": "echo test message logged every 1 minute"
        },
        "status": "scheduled"
    }
]

```

### Remove a scheduled job

Send a DELETE to endpoint `http://localhost:3100/scheduler` using this JSON structure as payload

```
{
    "jobName":"testJob"
}


curl -X DELETE -d '{"jobName":"testJob"}' http://localhost:3100/scheduler --header "Content-Type:application/json"
```

### scheduled job persistence
The scheduler uses a JSON file to persist information about the scheduled job. This will be used when the server it is restarted. the JSON structure persisted looks like

```
[{
            "jobName": "testJob",
            "time": "*/1 * * * *",
            "action": "echo test message logged every 1 minute"
}]
```

the path to the configuration file can be configured using the ENV variable `IO_GW_SCHEDULER_CONFIG`. If not available the scheduler fallback to the a default config file
`${HOME}/io-sdk-scheduler-config.json` inside the home folder of the user running the node.js server.

### Builing docker image and launch

Execute

```
make build
make start
```

The example makefile launch a docker instance running the image mount the `${HOME}` onto the container path `/scheduler/config` and set the 
ENV variable `IO_GW_SCHEDULER_CONFIG='/scheduler/config/io-sdk-scheduler-container-config.json'`
